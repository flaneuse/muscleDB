# About MuscleDB

The [Hughes](http://openwetware.org/wiki/HughesLab) (UMSL) and [Esser](http://www.uky.edu/~kaesse2/lab_web_7_2007/SMBL/) (Univ. of Kentucky School of Medicine) labs are assembling a database of muscle tissue gene expression in mice.  Our purpose is to survey the diversity of transcription in skeletal muscle (with exemplar smooth and cardiac muscles for comparison), and provide a resource for the field as a whole.  

In this repository, we’re developing a web-based platform to explore, visualize, and share these data build on a [Shiny dashboard](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).

* If you've noticed any  technical errors or enhancements to this webpage, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/flaneuse/muscle-transcriptome/issues).

* If you want to help us understand which muscle types would be most useful to you, 
please vote for your preferred tissues [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1iL9V7HPm5CRekPrkrPmLciZmNWK-g09elIYLnFbV59g/viewform?usp=send_form). 

* If there are any compelling reasons you'd like us to consider your favorite tissues,
